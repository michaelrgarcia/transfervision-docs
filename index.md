Welcome to the documentation for [TransferVision].

TransferVision is a full-stack web application that allows a user to conveniently view all [ASSIST.org] articulations for the selected UC/CSU requirement at once. It supports all modernized ASSIST.org agreements, which are articulation agreements from 2023-2024 onward. At the time of writing this, support for AICCU institutions is not yet implemented.
