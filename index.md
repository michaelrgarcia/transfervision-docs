Welcome to the documentation for [TransferVision].

TransferVision is a full-stack web application that allows a user to conveniently view all [ASSIST.org] articulations for the selected UC/CSU requirement at once. It supports all modernized ASSIST.org agreements, which are articulation agreements from 2023-2024 onward. At the time of writing this, support for AICCU institutions is not yet implemented.

Rather than teaching the reader how to use TransferVision, this will be an in-depth overview of how TransferVision works behind the scenes. It is suggested to start reading about the [backend] first, as it is where most of TransferVision's operations take place.
